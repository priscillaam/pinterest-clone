# Pinterest Clone PWA
This project is a clone of Pinterest, recreated using React and styled components. It imports stock photos from Unsplash API to fill out the pins and has several functional navigation buttons and selectors.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to showcase my skills in styling web pages and structuring them using React components. It is intended to be used as a demonstration for potential employers and clients.

## Technologies
This project was built using React JavaScript, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. Unsplash API was used to import stock images to fill out the pins.

## Installation
This project is a progressive web application, which means that it can be downloaded and installed through the browser. It is designed to function as a desktop application, but is not suitable for mobile devices.

To install the application, simply navigate to the URL where the application is hosted using Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge. Then, click on the Install button in the browser menu and follow the instructions to download and install the application. Once installed, you can launch the application from your desktop or Start menu.

If you want to run the application locally, you can clone the repository and run npm install to install the dependencies. After that, you can run npm start to start the development server. However, note that this will not give you the full functionality of the progressive web application.

## Features
